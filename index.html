            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <article id="overview">
                The Pokemon universe has been expanding for almost 30 years, and new regions are constantly being
                explored. With the introduction of the latest region, Paldea, there are now over 1,000 Pokemon that can
                be of 18 different elemental types and also have unique characteristics. Additionally, people from all
                over the world train these Pokemon and use them in battles. With so many species, trainers, and battles
                to keep track of, it’s been increasingly difficult for Team Rocket, a villainous team that wants to
                capture the most powerful Pokemon for themselves, to plan their next move. So, Team Rocket requires a
                database that will allow them to record details about Pokemon, especially which ones are the rarest and
                most powerful (classified as Mythical or Legendary). This database will also allow them to monitor the
                affiliations of trainers and other relevant people and record battle outcomes. This database will help
                them to identify the most valuable Pokemon and track the activities of rival teams.
